The hardest part about this project was animating the dice. Was an extremely fun
challenge. I have been trying to do normal vanilla JavaScript projects as
React.js projects to familiarize myself with React.js more. Though this ended up
being more of a CSS project than a React.js one. The base calculations and code
for retrieving a randomized dice roll was easy.
